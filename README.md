==IMPORTANT!!!==

I DID NOT MAKE THIS APPLICATION! IT WAS ORIGINALLY MADE BY LR-Soft BUT THE GOOGLE PLAY STORE PAGE GOT TAKEN DOWN. 

This repository is here so you can install the application again. This is not affiliated with LR-Soft or Microsoft. Windows 98 trademarks belong to Microsoft and Windows 98 simulator was developed by LR-Soft. 

~Installation Instructions~
Note: This does not work for iPhone, sorry!

1. Download the .APK file, it may say "This file may be harmful, are you sure you want to install it?" If so, click allow.

2. Once you have downloaded the file, click on the .APK to install it. If you have not installed any APK's before it may say "Are you sure you want to allow from source?" Click the toggle to allow from source. 

3. Once the application is installed you do not need the .APK so you can remove it.

4. Now go to your home screen and it should have been installed!

PS. Windows 98 Simulator may need acess to your Files (So you can look at them in the app) and app access (So you can launch them through the app itself.) Click allow or deny depending on if you want to use those features or not. And lastly, this is a simulator, not an emulator so you cannot run Win16 or 32 Programs. 

Thanks for using this repository!
