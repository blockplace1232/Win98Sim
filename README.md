==IMPORTANT!!!==

I DID NOT MAKE THIS PROGRAM!IT WAS MADE BY LR-Soft BUT THE GOOGLE PLAY PAGE GOT TAKEN DOWN. 

This repository is here so you can install the program again. 

~Installation Instructions~
Note: This does not work for iPhone, sorry!

1. Download the .APK file, it may say "This file may be harmful, are you sure you want to install it?" If so, click allow.

2. Once you have downloaded the file, click on the .APK to install it. If you have not installed any APK's before it may say "Are you sure you want to allow from source?" Click the toggle to allow from source. 

3. Once the program is installed you do not need the .APK so you can uninstall it. It should now be installed and you can use this program again!

NOTE: If you want to use the android app launcher and file viewer, click allow file access.
